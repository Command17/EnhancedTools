## Enhancing 🔨

The enhancing mechanic lets you enhance your tools for more durability and attack damage.

To enhance your tool you need a **copper enhancing smithing template** (what a name, huh?),
which can be traded with tool smiths and weapon smiths for a price of **4-7 diamonds and a block of copper**.

They can't be duplicated with crafting.
